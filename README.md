# Simple Security Ticketing

## Objective
This lab provided an overview of security ticketing systems, focusing on how they are used to track, manage, and resolve security incidents within an organization. I learned about the key components of a ticketing system, including ticket creation, categorization, prioritization, and resolution workflows. This foundational understanding is essential for roles in cybersecurity operations and incident response.

### Skills Learned

- Understanding the purpose and function of security ticketing systems
- Navigating common components of a ticketing platform (e.g., ticket creation, updates, resolution)
- Prioritizing tickets based on severity and impact
- Escalating tickets to others
- Closing tickets in queue with detailed explanation of resolution


### Tools Used
- Open-source ticketing application: TheHive

## Steps
1. I wanted to get familiar with my ticketing queue so I viewed the first ticket. I noticed important idenfication markers (like  username, ticket creation, assignee, etc) and reviewed ticket details.

2.
I wanted to create a ticket, which I titled "My First Ticket". This allowed me to get hands-on experience of ticket creation.

3.
I figured that the ticket needed to be escalated to a different party. To do this, I made sure to write a comment so I could document the issue and communicate it to the team.

4. To complete the lab I had to close one of the tickets in my queue. I picked the one title "Excessive Authentication Failures for Single User", then chose a new status and explained in details why I was closed the ticket.
